# AGTC-JS
## Antenna G/T Calculator

### Origin
The story has begun with programs written in QB64.
Look at <https://www.dg7ybn.de/Ant_soft/Antenna_GT_f5fod.htm> for further explanations and to get access to the corresponding .bas and .exe files.
Or you may prefer to get all the relevant information here: <https://github.com/f5fod/AGTC-QB64>.

Now, in 2026, the *AGTC_anyGTa_2lite_V2-00.bas* is translated in the present *AGTC-JS* html file!

### How to use this *AGTC-JS* html file
First of all, create a FFTab (Far Field Table) file with EZNEC or 4nec2.
Next use this html *AGTC-JS* file which will calculate the G/T ratio of your antenna.
